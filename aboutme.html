      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Stephen Aranda</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Stephen Aranda and this page is dedicated to introducing myself. I am a nineteen year old student that attends Florida Gulf Coast University and I am majoring in Software Engineering. Some hobbies of mine include learning interesting things, watching anime, watching professional football and basketball, playing video games, and creating things. I am originally from the Bay Area in California so naturally I am a huge fan of the San Francisco 49ers, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Giants, and the San Jose Sharks.<br /><br />In the future, I plan on doing many things with the knowledge that I gain from my college education, such as finding an employer that relates to my degree, creating my own website through coding, creating my own programs, and creating a video game of my own.<br /><br />Here is a song that reminds me of my childhood growing up in the city along with a picture of the famous Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
