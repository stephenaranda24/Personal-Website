    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Stephen Aranda</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Stephen Aranda and this page is dedicated to introducing myself. I am a nineteen year old student that attends Florida Gulf Coat University and I am majoring in Software Engineering. Some hobbies of mine include learning interesting things, watching anime, watching professional football and basketball, playing video games, and creating things. I am originally from the Bay Area in California so naturally I am a huge fan of the San Francisco 49ers, Golden state Warriors, San Francisco Giants, and the San Jose Sharks.<br /><br />In the future, I plan on doing with the knowledge that I gain from my college education such as finding an employer that relates to my degree, creating my own website through coding, creating my own programs, and creating a video game of my own.</p>
