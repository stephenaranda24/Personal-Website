    <h2>Stephen Aranda</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Stephen Aranda and this page is dedicated to introducing myself. I am a nineteen year old student that attends Florida Gulf Coat University and I am majoring in Software Engineering. Some hpbbies of mine include learning interesting things, watching anime, watching professional football and basketball, playing video games, and creating things. I am originally from the Bay Area in California so naturally I am a huge fan of the San Francisco 49ers, Golden state Warriors, San Francisco Giants, and the San Jose Sharks.</p>
