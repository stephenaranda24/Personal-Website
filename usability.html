          <h1>Usability for My Website</h1>
            <p> I made this website with the intention of it being simplistic and easy to use as it is my very first website I have ever made. In this page I will go over the usability and accessibility of the website in all aspects including visuals, audio, navigations, and future plans I have in mind.
              <h2>Visuals</h2> 
                <p> The visual throughout the website were each put in to help my audience have a better idea on the points I was trying to get across. I made sure that the size and placement of each photo and video was just right so that it looked and fit well.</p>
              <h2>Audio</h2>
                <p> The audio I included into this project was set right next to a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge in the "About Me" tab to give my audience a better understanding of my personality. </p>
              <h2>Navigation</h2>
                <p> I purposely made the navigations on my website to me very straight forward and simple. Each link I incorporated into the pages directs the audience to the said area without trouble. I also made sure that there was a way to go back into whatever section of my website you wanted to from any tabs, without having to press the back button to make it a lot more convenient and professional. </p>
              <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p> My future plans for this website include some more complicated coding to make my website as appealing to whoever is on it as possible. With the use of HTML, CSS, and Java Script, along with any other froms of coding I learn I can continue to improve this website. </p>
