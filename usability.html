          <h1>Usability for My Website</h1>
            <p> I made this website with the inention of it being simplistic and easy to use as it is my very first website I have ever made. In this page I will go over the usability and accessibility of the website in all aspects including visuals, navigations, and future plans I have in mind.
              <h2>Visuals<h2> 
                <p> The visual throughout the website were each put in to help my audience have a beter idea on the points I was trying to get across. I made sure that the size and placement of each photo and video was just right so that it look and fit well.</p>
